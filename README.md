# Non-Euclidean Geometry
### Godot Tech Demo of Non-Euclidean Geometry. Inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8).

## How it Works
This tech demo uses the same techniques shown in the reference video. Where the "tunnel entrances" are actually solid textures, which render a separate camera perspective onto the surface. When you walk into the surface, it teleports you into another location.
